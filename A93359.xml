            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Something further laid open of the cruel Perſecution of the People called QUAKERS By the Magiſtrates and People of <hi>EVESHAM.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving ſuffered much by the Rude People, as Dirting, Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Stocking, Spitting and Piſſing upon, and having been often aſſaulted with great companies of rude people in our meetings, &amp; having ſuffered much Abuſe and Violence, not onlie in our meetings but alſo in the Priſon, upon us who were priſoners, who were at ſometimes 20. in number, concerning which I ſhal mention little, but direct the Reader to two printed Papers, one with this Title, <hi>(A repreſentation of the Government of</hi> Eveſham, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> but eſpecially to another, titled <hi>(The cruelty of the Magistrates of</hi> Eveſham) wherein is laid open the manner of their proceedings againſt us, with their moſt unjuſt actings of thoſe that ſate to do Juſtice there againſt us at the general Seſſions held for that place, where many of us were fined, and eleven priſoned, yet not any law could be read unto us that we had broken: But to lay open ſome more of the moſt inhumane dealings of him cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mayor, with the reſt of the perſecuting Magiſtrates againſt us.</p>
            <p>Friends, Having ſuffered much by the rude multitude, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during all patiently, at laſt they grew aſhamed and confounded, and then they grew more quiet, and friends met peaceably twice or thrice a week, ſo that the ignorant began to be convinced, and the gain-ſayers mouthes ſtopped, and much people received the truth in love, whereby the meetings were encreaſed, &amp; the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers mouthes ſtopped, and the work of the Lord begun to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; thus we countinued a certain ſpce day by day in peace, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168358:2"/> then there aroſe up a new Mayor, who knew not the Righteous ſeed, as there aroſe up a new King in Egypt, Exod. 1 and he ſaw the people of God encreaſe, and was vexed at it, as the world was alwaies vexed at the encreaſe of the Righteous Seed; ſo that Mayor <hi>(Edward Young)</hi> ſaid he would break our meetings, or elſe his bones ſhould lye in the dirt, the which he did. Upon the 14. day of the 8. month, being the firſt day of the week, friends met in a houſe; and as two friends of the town were going to the meeting, the Mayor laid hands on them and put them in Priſon. And in the latter part of the day friends met in the ſtreet, where they were peaceably without any diſturbance, until the Mayor came with Officers, and ſaid, it was an unlawful Aſſembly; &amp; ſaid, if there were above eight perſons met together, it was an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Aſſemblie, and preſentlie laid hands on friends, and pulled, and thruſt, and kickt many, and put many into priſon and into the Stocks and put me and two more into the Dungeon; &amp; when he ſaw that friends were not afraid, and that his cruelty could not move them, he ſaid he wanted another priſon for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (for he had impriſoned men in four ſeverall places:) that time when this was done, he commanded his Sergeant to make a noiſe and proclaim and command, in the name of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, that every one ſhould depart thence upon pain of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, when he wanted more priſons to put us in: Thus he broke our meetings who harmed not any, nor reſiſted his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Then he ſaid if we would meet in houſes or in the fields, he would not moleſt us: Yet, on the next firſt day, he ſaw one of the Town going along to the meeting that we had then appointed in a houſe, and him he put in priſon, and ſo I being that day put in the Dungeon, as once before I was put in for praying, then he endeavoured to keep all people from me and for ſeveral dayes and nights we were denyed having candles in this dark dungeon; at laſt he ſent us each man a pennyworth of bread, and a half pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth of beere, the which the Goaler ſaid was the Towns al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, but we ſtill denyed it, and ſent him word, That if we ſhould not have food for our money, or from our friends, then we ſhould be without it: So at laſt when we could have bread from our friends, and water when we could have it, then we did eat and drink and praiſe the Lord.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:168358:2"/>
            <p>Thus he much endeavoured to bring us to ſlavery to his corrupt wil, which was according to the words of <hi>Robert Atkins</hi> that ſate Judg at the ſeſſions, who then ſaid to me thus, You have been kept very high, but I ſhal take a courſe ere I go hence, that you ſhall be kept ſhorter. And the mayor, Edward Young, cauſed a trap-door to be made to the Dungeon, and locked down, &amp; all our bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and bed-cloathes that friends had ſent us, he cauſed to bee taken avvay from us, and wil not let our friends have them again. <hi>Ioſhua Frenſom,</hi> a friend &amp; priſoner, having much pain with his teeth did ſomthing earneſtly deſire that whil'ſt he was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, he might have the uſe of a pillow that was taken away, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was his own, but it was denied. On the ſecond day after we were put into the dungeon, a friend brought us ſome ſtraw to ly upon but the goaler would not ſuffer it to be brought in to us, becauſe they would not give him mony for to open the door. Once I ſent to the Mayor to have liberty for ſome man or friend to fetch out, our dung from us, &amp; he denied it, and ſent for a Cunſtable to put that friend in the ſtocks that came to ask it; and while I was in the other priſon, before I was put in the dungeon, ſometimes our books &amp; writings were taken from us, and ſometimes our ſtools that we had to ſit or write upon &amp; our candles, beſides much abuſe which our friends received from the goaler, who were priſoners at his houſe, which I ſhal forbear to mention, onely thus he ſaid unto them, if they would not pay 4. d. a night for each mans lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, &amp; 8. d. a meal for each mans meat, then they ſhould go all to the main goal, which they refuſing to ſatisfie his wil in, neither did they eat of his dyet, being all townſmen; but ſometime he would not ſuffer their wives nor any other friend to come to them to bring their diet, nor yet to come in to them: then a man got leave of him that dwelt next houſe to the goaler, and ſo went through his houſe &amp; brought food to the priſoners, which when the goaler ſaw, he threatned the man which had ſuffered them to go through his houſe, and took the beer from them that brought it to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, intending by ſuch actions to force them to his will, which they would not be ſubject to, therefore he brought them all to the main-goal, and then he ſaid unto us, that if he might have his will he would hang us all on the morrow, and he had ſaid before he might do what he would unto us, for we ſhould have no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Law, neither durſt any Lawyer plead for us. Then were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168358:3"/> them eight kept in that Goal, and we three in the Dungeon under them, where I and ſome others have been kept in this Dungeon and Priſon, with our own dung in the ſame room, from time to time for this fourteen Weeks.</p>
            <p>And as for the Priſon or Hole where we are kept, it is not 12. foot ſquare, and one Goal-hole belonging to, four inches wide, where we take in our food and ſtraw to lie upon, and we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to burn candle every day when we have it, by reaſon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſo dark and ſo cloſe, and ſo many in ſo little room, and ſo little ayre, with the ſtinck of our own dung, all which might have occaſioned the death of ſome of us ere this time; &amp; one they kept with me in the dungeon until he was ſick, &amp; after turned him out in the night; and ſome others have not been wel by reaſon of the exceeding cloſeneſs of the priſon, whereby ſometimes the ſtinck of the priſon hath been ſo ſtrong in the ſtreets, that people could not endure to ſtand by it. Sometimes when the dayes were hot the breath of ſome priſoners vvas almoſt ſtopped, and lay for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall dayes like men aſleep; and vvhen the dayes are at the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, vve have not room nor place either to make fire or to vvalk to keep our bodies vvarm; yet there is a large priſon over our heads, where they do ſometime priſon many of our friends, but that large priſon they will not let us be in, neither could we, nor friends for us, prevail to have liberty to walk in that priſon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by day, and to come down into the other priſon by night.</p>
            <p>Therefore let all people take notice, whoſe hearts is tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord, how we are not only deprived of outward liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without the breach of any law, but are alſo kept in a moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous condition, worſe than thieves and murtherers, as the goaler hath ſaid, that if we had been in for theft or murther, he could have let us have more liberty then now he durſt, becauſe of the Mayor.</p>
            <p>One day two Countrey men were paſſing by the priſon with their Teams, which men came and enquired what we were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for, and the Goaler being by, enticed them in to us, and then he locked the door again and went his way; ſo the men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by reaſon of their Teams, to ſend ſeveral meſſengers with entreating words to the Goaler to come again, &amp; then they were forced to agree with him for to let them forth for money, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168358:3"/> which they preſently paid. Another time one of the town came to ſee us when the Goaler was there and the doors open, and the Goaler locked the door and kept him in that day from his labor, and the night, and his wife nor her friends could not prevaile with the Mayor nor the Goaler, to let him out without money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Wall,</hi> who had been a ſouldier many years, and ſerved an Apprentiſhip in the Town, and a Freeman thereof, and have born ſeverall Offices, being a Shop-keeper, having for ſeven years kept a ſtanding in the Market place, untill ſince he was a priſoner for witneſſing the Truth; yet the Mayor, Edward Young, forbad his Wife to ſtand in the Market place, which for ſo many years he had done, neither would he let her ſtand that time where he was wont to do, nor in any part of the Market place; then ſhe went to him about it, and once he ſaid ſhe ſhould have a ſtanding for to open in the market, but after he began to ſpeak ſuttlely to her, ſaying, I hear that your Husband doth abuſe you: She anſwered, my Husband did never abuſe me; but as for that judgement which he now holdeth, once I could not own it, but now ſeeing it is ſo much perſecuted, makes me own it, becauſe the way of God was alwayes perſecuted; &amp; vvhen the mayor heard that, and ſaw he could have no occaſion againſt her Husband by her words, then he ſaid ſhe ſhould not have a ſtanding place for five pounds. Alſo two of <hi>Iames Walls</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came to him, with whom he had dealed much, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts were large, and ſome money he owed them, who went to the mayor, and proffered him what Baile he would deſire for him to come forth one day to perfect his Accounts, but they could not prevail with him, but the mayor ſaid to them, that if they vvould have a Warrant to ſeize on his Goods they ſhould, but the men ſaid they had no reaſon ſo to do, for the mayor he ſeeks to ruinate not onely him, but all the other alſo. Upon that daye vve came before the late mayor, George Kempe, I ſaid, I ovvn Magiſtrates that are for the puniſhing of evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the praiſe of them that do vvell, he anſvvered, You vvill finde none ſuch in England; (And I am ſure I finde none ſuch in Eveſham.)</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:168358:4"/>
            <p>Vpon the 17. day of the 9. month <hi>Margret Newby,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Courten,</hi> came to this town in obedience to the Lord, who had a meeting on the morrow, being the firſt day, at <hi>Edward Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi> houſe, and after the meeting was ended, about the fourth hour in the latter part of the day, they came to the priſon to viſit us that were in it, and as they were returning the Mayor laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on them himſelf, and ſent for Officers, and cauſed them to be put in a pair of ſtocks in a priſon over us, which ſtocks are worſe than ordinary, made for hands &amp; feet to be put in, &amp; when the Conſtable had put them in thoſe ſtocks, the Mayor went up to the priſon to ſee if they were put in bad enough &amp; the Conſtable had put them in one near to another, and the Mayor cauſed the ſtocks to be opened, and removed them one as far from another, as might be one at the one end of the ſtocks, and the other at the other, and the holes that are for the hands their hands were to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and he made them put in their legs a yeard one from another, and the women deſired a block to ſit on it being a great diſtance between the place where they were to ſit, and the places in which their legs were put; and the mayor bid the conſtable fetch a block and thruſt it between their legs, &amp; ſaid they ſhould not have them between their legs which they would have, &amp; other uncivil words he uſed, and locked the priſon door, and went his way, and would not ſuffer any to go to them to carry any cloaths or any thing for them to ſit on, in a moſt barbarous and cruel manner for the ſpace of fifteen hours; and after they had been in all that time, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently (after he had cauſed them to be taken out) ſent them out of the town a back way, without ſuffering them to go to any place to refreſh themſelves, it being a freezing night. And the ſame firſt day at evening he cauſed a friend that came to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hole, who came to the tovvn the day before, him he cauſed to be put in the common ſtocks, not ſhovving him any reaſon vvhy they did it; and after he had been in the ſtocks all that freezing night in the ſtreet, then the Mayor ſent him out of the tovvn by the Goaler, and vvhen the Goaler had left him he returned to the tovvn again along the road vvay, it being the Market day, &amp; came to the priſon to us, and then vvent to the Mayor to knovv vvhat offence he had to charge him vvith, that he thus puniſhed him, but the Mayor having nothing to accuſe him of, vvas vvrath,

            <p>Then they ſent for Robert Vens, who did go along with that friend out of the town, that had been in the ſtocks all night, and when Robert Vens came before them called Juſtices, <hi>Samuel Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi> and <hi>Robert Martin;</hi> the one of them ſaid, what ſhall we do with this fellow? the other anſwered, put him in the Goal and hang him; but at laſt they ſent him to ſtocks, and he knows no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they did it, but for going with the other friend out of the town; &amp; when he had been in the ſtocks five hours, then they ſent for him to ſee what the Goaler had to charge him with for any words that he might ſpeake when he went with the other friend; ſo when they had puniſhed him, they went to enquire what fault he had done.</p>
            <p>Some of the Inhabitants of the town intended to ſend two men to the Protector (when this perſecution begun in Eveſham; and the corruption of the Magiſtrates did ſo plainly appear) to let him know what corrupt men were in authority in this town, and they writ ſomthing to that effect to ſend by them, the which wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was ſubſcribed about fifty hands to it; but I ſaid unto them, that they might put themſelves to much trouble, and yet not ſpeak with the Protector; therefore if they would not otherwiſe be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, they might put ſome four hands to it and ſend it to print, and then I ſhould endeavour to have it ſent to the Protector, that he might be left without excuſe; ſo they ſent it to print with 20. hands to it, which was titled, <hi>A Repreſentation of the Government of</hi> Eveſham <hi>from many of the Inhabitants thereof, directed unto the Protector,</hi> O. C.</p>
            <p>And at the Seſſions many of them were fined, and ſome were both fined and impriſoned ever ſince in the Protectors name, for declaring to the Protector the corruption of thoſe that are put in authority under the Protector, who act contrary to the Protectors laws againſt thoſe that have been faithfull ſouldiers both for the Parliament and the Protector, and there is not any friend at any time, that can by any means ſince the Seſſions, procure by any means, or buy for money, a copy of our Indictments.</p>
            <p>And let all people take notice, that all that is printed in the firſt, ſecond, and this third book, is all but a ſhort declaration to what might be printed of the perſecutions of Prieſts Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
